We worked on Assignments 1 and 2 collaboratively with equal contribution. 

For assignment 2, I also discussed with Le Xu and get help from Yao Wang.



Assignment 3:

## 1. 

## Idea: Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

### Null Hypothesis: the average weight loss of diets group is less or same than the average weight loss of exercise group.
### $\alpha$ = 0.05

### $S_0:$ The average weight of control group minus the average weight of diets group in 3 months.

### $S_1:$ The The average weight of control group minus the average weight of exercise group in 3 months.

### $H_0: S_0 - S_1$ <= 0

### $H_a: S_0 - S_1$ >  0


## 2. 

## Idea: Do American trust the president? 
## POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

### Null Hypothesis: equal or less than half of americans claim Bill Clinton has met their expectation as a president.
### $\alpha$ = 0.05

### $S_0:$ Percentage of people who claimed that Bill Clinton had met their expectation in honesty and integrity.

### $S_1:$ Percentage of people who claimed that Bill Clinton had not met their expectation in honesty and integrity.

### $H_0: S_0 - S_1$ <= 0

### $H_a: S_0 - S_1$ >  0


## 3. 

## Idea: Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit.
## Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

### Null Hypothesis: Smokers used placebo patch has a higher or same rate of cessation than smokers used nicotine patch in 6 months.
### $\alpha$ = 0.05

### $S_0:$ Percentage of smokers who use nicotine patch quit smoking in 6 months

### $S_1:$  Percentage of smokers who use placebo patch quit smoking in 6 months

### $H_0: S_0 - S_1$ <= 0

### $H_a: S_0 - S_1$ >  0


## 4. 

## Idea: Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. 
## Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

### Null Hypothesis: the rate of IQ development of children from age 1 to 4 of pregnant women with smoking is higher or equal than children of pregnant women without smoking.
### $\alpha$ = 0.05

### $S_0:$ the average rate of IQ development of children from age 1 to 4 of pregnant women without smoking

### $S_1:$ the average rate of IQ development of children from age 1 to 4 of pregnant women with smoking

### $H_0: S_0 - S_1$ <= 0

### $H_a: S_0 - S_1$ >  0
