Two seasons rideships look very similar except upper east side of Manhattan which is more like a residential area in Manhattan.
Also, we will notice in Brooklyn, around Brooklyn Navy Yard Development, summer and winter shows difference as well.
Reason could be more clear with futher investigation.  For now, I could not tell a really good reason why would have this kind of difference.
