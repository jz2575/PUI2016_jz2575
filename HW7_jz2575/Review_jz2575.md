# PUI 2016 HW8 - Peer Review By Kelsey Reid

![Plot Image](plot_jz2575.png)

For this plot I would suggest only minor changes to make the plot more easily readable and offer clarity. On the x axis label I would change the time interval description of 's' to 'seconds' just so that anyone reading the plot could quickly tell what the interval is. I would also recommend capitalizing the words in the title and the x axis label to provide a more polished finish. Otherwise the plot is clear and accurately depicts the number of riders with trips of a particular duration in seconds. The color and style of the plot are appropriate for the data being used for visualization.
