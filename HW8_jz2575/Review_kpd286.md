KDumanski’s plot is clean and simple, and I like it.  The plot is also properly labelled.  However, there is no title and caption for the plot, so I am not quite clear about what KDumanski is trying to tell us through this plot.  Also, the legend does not convey a clear idea to me.  I am not sure what Stabilized does represent just from the plot. 

I think it would be interesting if KDumanski can explain the relationship between Stabilized and Market Rate in the caption and tells us what he thinks about the patterns or trends of the percentage of rent to property tax reflecting to us.
