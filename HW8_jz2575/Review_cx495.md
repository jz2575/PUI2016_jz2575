Chunqing’s plot is clean and easy to read.  The plot is properly labelled, but the size of the labels is small to recognize.  I suggest the size of tick and label to be consistent.  Legend and caption are also included, but there is no comment to the plot.  Therefore, I am not clear what he is trying to convey through his plot.  In addition, the title is missing.

We can see a huge difference of ridership between subscribers and customers.  I recommend Chunqing to tell his thoughts about the huge difference.  And also due the huge difference, we can hardly tell the trends on the “Customers” itself like we see from the “Subscribers”.
