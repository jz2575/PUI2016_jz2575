where is the statement about work balance? what was your contribution to the project? you all should have written a singel collaborative article with all of you as authors.

the analysis is fine. but you have not exploited the functionality of authorea: the authors are not all listed with their accounts, so that this does not appear as a collaborative project, the sections are not separated etc etc. see notes in the article
