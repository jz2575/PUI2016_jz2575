First connect to compute use ssh -X -A -t jz2575@gw.cusp.nyu.edu ssh -A -X compute
After log in

1. use mkdir command to create the directory
2. use export to create a variable as PUI2016 and assign directory to it
such as PUI2016=/home/cusp/jz2575/PUI2016_jz2575
3. use alias with variable PUI2016 to create a command as pui2016
such as alias pui2016='cd $PUI2016'

To put PUI2016 and pui2016 into .bashrc file is basically editing .bashrc file using emacs .bashrc
